# personal/academic website
A personal/adademic website theme just with HTML/CSS (no Jekyll needed). Minimal CSS. Adapted from https://github.com/mdn/beginner-html-site-styled. Favicon generated using favicon.io.

Currently in the process of making this mobile friendly and responsive with js!

Feel free to use this for your own site (just fork this repository - there is already a static.yml file but make sure to use Github Action and the "Deploy static content to Pages" workflow).
